Self-Supervised Pansharpening Network Constrained by Orthogonal Space Projection Prior

Paper Status: Under submission. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Overview

This repository will host the implementation of the Self-Supervised Pansharpening Network Constrained by Orthogonal Space Projection Prior once the manuscript is accepted for publication.

Method

The proposed network integrates an orthogonal space projection prior into a self-supervised pansharpening framework to ensure high spatial details and spectral fidelity.

Code Availability

The code and scripts will be made publicly available on this GitHub repository as soon as we receive an acceptance notification from the journal/conference.
